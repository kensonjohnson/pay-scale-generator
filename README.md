I started this project to fill a need at work: my supervisor wanted a way to pay different employees fairly and I created a spreadsheet with a “Pay Scale” for him. 
Seeing his need to change the numbers himself, I created this app to generate new pay scales dynamically with JavaScript. 

## Highlights:

- User input is handled through a very fancy multi-step form with awesome slide-in animations.
- Information is generated dynamically based off of the users inputs.
- Content is displayed by manipulating the DOM via JavaScript.
